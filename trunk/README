			 spxml README

1.Introduction

spxml is a simple and plain xml parser written in C++. spxml supports
pull-model and DOM-model xml parsing.

The spxml code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested under
Solaris.

You can get the code from the spxml home page:

	http://code.google.com/p/spxml/

2.Building

To build libspxml.so, type

$ make

This will build all the targets include examples. You can run the
example programs:

$ testpull test.xml
$ testdom test.xml


Reports of successful use of spxml are appreciated.

Enjoy!
